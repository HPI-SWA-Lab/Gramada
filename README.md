# Gramada
Gramada is a live programming environment for developing programming languages. There is an online [demo video](https://vimeo.com/180190846) giving an overview of the Gramada tool set.

## Installation

### Get a Prepared Image
You can get a prepared image [here](https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/artefacts/gramada/).

### Build your Own
1. Get [Squeak 5.0 or later](http://www.squeak.org)
2. Load [Metacello](https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work). To speed up the process you can also get a prebuild Vivide image from the Vivide repository.
3. Execute the following script to install Gramada

````Smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'Gramada';
  repository: 'github://hpi-swa-lab/gramada/repository';
  load.
			
(Smalltalk at: #GramadaScripts) installAndOpenGramada.
````


## Updating
To update Gramada first pull the latest version of the git repository. Then execute the following script:

````Smalltalk
{
(Metacello new
  baseline: 'Vivide';
  repository: 'github://hpi-swa/vivide/repository') .
(Metacello new
  baseline: 'Ohm';
  repository: 'github://hpi-swa/ohm-s/packages') .
(Smalltalk at: #Metacello) new
  baseline: 'Gramada';
  repository: 'github://hpi-swa-lab/gramada/repository'
}
do: [:b | b get];
do: [:b | b load].
